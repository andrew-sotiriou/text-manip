Version 2:
Added initial commit of JQ version which will do the same as the JS version
Only visual difference is displaying a horizontal bar chart instead of a doughnut
Both sides are now working.

Version 1:

Initial Commit:
Takes a users input and will strip out all non alpha characters
Display the stripped string and size
Iterate through the string and count the number of times each letter appears
Pass those values to ChartJS and display the Chart

Note: I am planning to do one side with pure JS and one side using JQuery. Currently only the pure JS side is working.
